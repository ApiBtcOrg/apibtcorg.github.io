## 2025 Q2 — v1.1 (MainNet)
- **MainNet Support**:  
  APIBTC moves from RegTest to full Bitcoin MainNet compatibility, enabling real-world Bitcoin Lightning payments.
- **Wallet App (Android & iOS)**:

  This makes it easy for users and AI agents to receive and manage Bitcoin payments directly.

  Addition of webhook support for real-time notifications of payment and event updates, making integration with other apps and workflows seamless.

## 2025 Q4 — v1.3 (Bitcoin-Imperial)
- **Exchange Module**:  
  Introduction of a exchange feature, allowing Bitcoin-to-fiat swaps inside APIBTC.
